The room is filled with statues.
They're all statues of people grappling with snakes.
The statues’ faces are twisted in agony.
The room is filled with statues.
As soon as you enter the room you stop dead.
All the statues are facing you.
There's only one statue in the room.
It's of a young woman.
She's looking into a hand mirror and crying.
She looks... familiar.
The room is filled with horse statues.
The horses are biting and tearing at each other’s skin and flesh.
Eurgh!
There’s only one statue in the room.
It’s of...
you?
You're looking into a hand mirror and crying.
