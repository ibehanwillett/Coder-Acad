The first thing you notice in the study is the writing.
The walls are covered in it.
It spirals out from the writing desk like whoever started writing couldn’t stop. 
You can see when the ink must've run out; the words are scratched deep into the wall.
Oh no… you can also see when the writer realised they had their own ink…
You can read the writing.
It’s as clear as day.
The spiralling writing reads "MEAT MEAT MEAT MEAT MEAT"'.
Haha… it makes you smile.
You see some scattered matches on the writing desk.
Most of them have been ruined by the... ink... but some are still good.
You pick the matches up.
Matches are added to your inventory.
You leave them alone.
I don't know what you mean.
God... why does some of the ink still look wet?
