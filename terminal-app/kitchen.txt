The kitchen is as hot as a furnace!
The stove has been left on, flames rage from behind its glass window.
You try to turn it off but it's too hot to touch.
The air seems to shimmer with heat.
You see a sharp kitchen knife stabbed deep into the wooden countertop.
It looks out of place in the dilapidated kitchen, it’s too bright, too sharp.
The knife feels good in your hand, like it’s supposed to be there.
The knife is added to your inventory.
You leave the knife be, shining in the warm red light emanating from the oven.
You already have the knife, remember? It hasn't left your hand.
It's too hot to touch!
I didn't understand that.
