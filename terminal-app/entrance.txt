It’s been a long time since the entrance hall you’re standing in was cared for.
You can see it was once grand, but now it’s a pile of peeling wallpaper and rotten wood.
It must have taken a lot of time and care to lay each tile of the black and white parquet floor. 
Now, the tiles are cracked and ruined.
Sometimes, something hot and wet oozes from underneath when you step down on them.
You scream and bang on the door.
It remains locked
The wind howls outside.
