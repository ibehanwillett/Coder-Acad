You can hear the wind moaning outside.
You feel watched.
Somewhere else in the house you can hear the sound of stone grinding on stone.
Suddenly, you're struck by a ravenous hunger.
Your teeth feel wrong in your mouth. Your tongue is thick and leathery.
The floorboards creak underneath your feet.
Suddenly, your heart starts beating faster. You feel yourself clenching and unclenching your hands over and over.
You feel sick.
Somewhere else in the house a door slams.
You feel like thereâ€™s a small bug under your skin.
