The ghost says "Please...please don't go...".
The ghost is crying. She was beautiful once.
The ghost looks up at you through pale and watery eyes.
The ghost toys with the brass key hanging on her neck. She seems to have come to a decision.
"Fine," the ghost snaps out "Fine, I'll give you the key- if you can answer my riddle."'
Her eyes flash with- what? Spite? Rage? Sorrow?
You can't tell.'
The ghost’s once lovely face pales. "That’s… That's exactly right."'
Her lower lip trembles.
You feel the key slide into your pocket. It's cold as ice.
You can see the ghost trying to smile through her obvious sadness.
The ghost shrieks 'WRONG!’
A red cloud covers the mirror.
When it clears, the ghost is gone.
The words “YOU’LL NEVER LEAVE ME” are written on the mirror instead.
The ghost is gone. You hear the sound of muffled sobbing through the walls.
