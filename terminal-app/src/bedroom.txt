It's so dark...
It's too dark to see.
You have a candle, but nothing to light it with!
Something in the darkness moves.
You should go.
You try to light some matches...
You get a second of light!'
Briefly the bedroom becomes visible.
You see a bed, a wardrobe and… a mirror.
The reflection looking back at you isn’t yours. 
The match burns out, leaving you with only burnt fingertips and a stone of dread rising in your throat.
Best return with something to light the candle.
The tiny light of your candle illuminates the bedroom.
It’s strange…
The rest of the house was clearly grand at some point, but it’s obvious this room never was. 
The bed is small and spindly, tucked up into the corner.
The wardrobe is made of plain pine wood.
Everything looks dusty and uncared for.
The only thing that shines in this room is the mirror hung on the wall.
You draw closer.
Something weird happens.
The closer you get the foggier your reflection becomes.
You lean in close- and then the reflection clears.
You’re looking into the eyes of someone else. 
In the mirror is a ghost.
You can’t see anything. 
The darkness seems to press in on you.
You hear the noise of breaking glass somewhere in the room.
Time to go.
