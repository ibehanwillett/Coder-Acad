There's a dinner table set for two.
Whoever set the table set it with loving care.
The silverware is placed at perfect intervals, there’s white linen napkins to match the white table cloth, and underneath the dust the wine glasses look to be crystal.
But the food in the centre…
It looks like it was supposed to be a roast for dinner.
It’s been so long that whatever was on the plates doesn’t even smell anymore but is no longer recognizable.
You think that whatever used to be in the centre was a roast chicken?
It makes you so terribly sad to look at.
Whoever set this table set it a long time ago.
The only light in the room comes from a tall white candle on the table.
From the amount of white wax spilling from the candlestick holder you think this might not have been the first one lit here.
There's a table covered in decaying food.
The smell of rot is intense.
You blow out the candle.
The food on the dinner table suddenly splits open. The smell of rotting meat fills the air.
Out of the decay erupt a cacophonous flurry of flies and cockroaches.
They fly thick and fast at your face; you feel them getting tangled in your hair.
Some get into your mouth.
You can’t see anything.
Eventually it ends. 
The ceiling light above you turns on, it splutters on and off. 
You pick up the candle and put it in your pocket.
The candle is added to your inventory.
The skin of the roast chicken bulges slightly.
