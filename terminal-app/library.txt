The first thing that hits you when you enter the library is the smell.
Even before you walked through the doorway the smell of rot and mildew was overwhelming. 
You can see why; at some point the room above the library must have started leaking.
The heavy wooden bookshelves covering the wall are soaked through.
You can see mushrooms growing out of some books and black mould blooms everywhere.
The air in this room is so humid it feels like soup.
You feel like youâ€™re drowning everytime you take a breath. 
Most of the books have become swollen with water.
They've fused together.
Three books have been left in a glass cabinet and were somewhat protected.
Their ink is smeared but they still can be read.
You leave the books alone to their sombre, sodden rest.
