# Guide to Markdown Syntax!
## This is what a subheading looks like.
###### Maximum number of headings is 6. 
For a pargraph in Markdown you don't need a symbol. Putting your text in separate lines in the code won't be interpted as a paragraph. For that, you need...

A blank line.

## Tools to Embed and Display Code.
For example: You can use `. code` to open VS Code in the working directory.

For a whole code block you use triple backticks, such as:
``` py
def hello():
    print "Hello
 ```

You can specify the code language after the triple backticks and Markdown will format it for you. 

## Lists
1. Numbered
2. Lists
3. Are Written
4. As Such. 
5. (Remember to add the . and an space.)
6. If you use all ones it makes things easier to insert later.

- An unordered list
- looks like this.
